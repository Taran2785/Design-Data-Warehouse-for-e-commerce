# Design-Data-Warehouse-for-e-commerce

The data warehouse is a comprehensive technology that provides the key people within an enterprise with access to any level of the required information within the enterprise. It is an enterprise-wide framework that permits the management of all enterprise information.

In this project , we have designed data warehouse for E commerce data. 

In the data warehouse, we have fact tables and dimension tables. Fact tables contain measures, measures are organizational interests. Dimension tables contain attributes associated with facts.

So I developed this warehouse based on a star schema  On the other hand, identified dimension tables are Dim_costomer, Dim_seller, Dim_product, Dim_date.
